# Overview

This notebook is dedicated to the implementation of a Minesweeper game.

# Approach

Within the notebook, you will find various functions, each responsible for a specific part of the game’s development. Code sections containing questions are identified by the `# ✏️` marker.

> **Important Note**: Do not modify the input and output types or the number of inputs and outputs for the functions. These functions are interconnected, and altering their structure may disrupt the entire implementation pipeline.

> **Tip**: Take time to read and understand the existing code as it will assist you in completing the missing parts more effectively.
